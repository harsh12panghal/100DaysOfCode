# 100DaysOfCode
Taking on the 100 days coding challenge! Let's make everyday count!

# Day 1
  Given an array we have to find the peak element of the array.

# Day 2
In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. 
Rick has n empty baskets, the ith basket is at position[i], Morty has m balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the 
minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.

# Day 3
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within days days. We have to distribure the weights in such a manner
that all the days are used and need to find the min load division that uses all the days. 

# Day 4
Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.
You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.
The main challenge was to solve this problem with O(nlog(n)) time complexity, so I used Merge sort algo. 

# Day 5
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
